    <h2>The Untold Story of the Crypto Queen – Rising from Sichuan</h2>

    <p>
        She comes from a small village in Sichuan Province, southwest China. Today, Yi He is 39 and a billionaire – pulling the strings of the most powerful crypto empire in the world! Her recipe: a mix of groundedness and relentless ambition.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is the crypto queen hardly anyone knows?</h3>

    <p>
        Yi He, raised in humble circumstances as the daughter of a pair of teachers, had her first job as a promoter for soft drinks in front of a supermarket. Looking back in an interview, she said: "It was a tough job, and all the talking and promoting made my voice hoarse." Yi He studied psychology. After graduating in 2006/2007 at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, she realized she would earn little on this path. "Most people in my hometown drop out of school before turning 16 to work in factories. I also questioned the nature of money and read many books but found no answer," she said in 2023. 
    </p>

    <p>
        She looked for jobs in media, hosted travel shows on Chinese television, then moved into marketing in the startup world, where in 2013 she came into contact with crypto for the first time at events. She was fascinated! She saw more equality and freedom in the financial system. So Yi He founded her first Bitcoin startup called OkCoin herself.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        The company remained small – but during this period, a key relationship emerged: her private life remained strictly private, but she met Chinese-Canadian businessman Changpeng Zhao (48). Together they founded Binance in 2017. Binance grew within months to become the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. While her co-founder quickly became well-known worldwide as CZ, Yi He acted as a strategic architect in the background. Her leadership style is notorious: new Binance employees must first work in customer support to understand how users think and act.
    </p>

    <p>
        About her co-founder she said: "During this phase of rapid development, I sometimes acted too boldly, and CZ gave me direct and constructive feedback. He kept me grounded and always ensured that my team and I did the right things. It helped me develop quickly, reflect, and gradually mature."
    </p>

    <p>
        High praise – only later did it become known that Yi He and CZ are also a couple; they are now said to be parents of three children. The two came together in a world full of promise – but also a negative image. China banned all Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2021. Binance’s headquarters are reportedly on the Cayman Islands; Yi He and CZ live in Abu Dhabi.
