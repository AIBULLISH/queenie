<div class="section">
    <h2>The Untold Story of the Crypto Queen – Rise from Sichuan</h2>

    <p>
        She comes from a small village in Sichuan province, southwest China. Today, Yi He is 39 and a billionaire – 
        pulling the strings of the world's most powerful crypto empire! Her recipe: a mix of groundedness and relentless ambition.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is the crypto queen hardly anyone knows?</h3>

    <p>
        Yi He, raised in humble conditions as the daughter of two teachers, had her first job as a promoter for soft drinks 
        in front of a supermarket. Looking back, she said in an interview: “It was a tough job, and all the talking and promoting 
        made my voice hoarse.” She studied psychology, but after graduating in 2006/2007 at the Institute of Psychology, 
        Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, she realized she wouldn’t earn much that way. “Most people in my hometown drop out 
        before 16 to work in factories. I also questioned the nature of money at that time, read many books, but found no answer,” 
        she said in 2023. She then sought jobs in media, hosted travel shows on Chinese TV, and moved into start-up marketing, 
        where she first came into contact with crypto at events in 2013. She was fascinated! She saw more fairness and freedom 
        in the financial system, and soon founded her first Bitcoin start-up, OkCoin.
    </p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">Image Placeholder</div>

    <h2>Yi He keeps her private life secret – and acts strategically for her company</h2>

    <p>
        The company remained small – but during this period, a key relationship emerged: Yi He keeps her private life strictly private, 
        but she met Chinese-Canadian businessman Changpeng Zhao (48). Together, they founded Binance in 2017. Binance quickly became 
        the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. While her co-founder instantly gained fame as CZ, she acted as 
        the strategic architect in the background. Her leadership style is legendary: new Binance employees must first work in customer 
        service to understand how users think and act.
    </p>

    <p>
        About her co-founder, she said: “During this phase of rapid growth, I sometimes acted too boldly, and CZ gave me direct and 
        constructive feedback. He kept me grounded and always ensured that the team and I did the right thing. It helped me develop 
        quickly, reflect, and gradually mature.”
    </p>

    <p>
        High praise – it was only later revealed that Yi He and CZ are also a couple; they are now parents of three children. 
        The two came together in a world full of promise, but also with a negative image. China banned all Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies 
        in 2021. Binance is based on the Cayman Islands; Yi He and CZ live in Abu Dhabi.

    <p>
        Then the break: Binance was accused of not having sufficient controls in place on its exchange, allowing transactions for criminals, 
        sanctioned countries, and other risky activities. CZ was sentenced to four months in prison for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. 
        He was released in September 2024.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yi He stepped out of invisibility during this time. She took responsibility, stabilized the company, and prevented it from being 
        crushed under global regulatory pressure. Since 2022, she has been in charge of Binance Labs – the billion-dollar investment arm 
        of the crypto giant. There, she decides which Web3 projects get funding and go big. With her decisions, she not only sets the daily 
        course but also helps shape the blockchain of tomorrow.
